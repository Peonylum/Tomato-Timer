## Context and Problem Statement

We discussed whether we should support a responsive design.  Should our design support different screen sizes?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Accessibility  
* Difficulty in implementation  
* Impending deadlines  

## Considered Options

* Support responsive design and therefore other screen sizes  
* No responsive design and simply have it support one screen size  

## Decision Outcome  

Chosen option: "Support Responsive design", because it is necessary to make our product usable across different user bases  

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* This should improve the quality of our site for users other than those in 1080p  

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The team has an added workload prior to the deadline coming up
