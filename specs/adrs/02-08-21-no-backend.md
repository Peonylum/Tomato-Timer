# [short title of solved problem and solution]

* Status: accepted 
* Deciders: Team-wide (2/8/21)
* Date: 2/8/21

## Context and Problem Statement

We are trying to decide whether our project needs a back end.  Would it make sense to have one in this scenario?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Complexity
* Time-line

## Considered Options

* local storage
* back-end such as mongodb

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "local storage" because we now know that a backend is not necessary for our timer to function.  It also makes more sense in regards to our time-line and removing from added complexity.

### Positive Consequences 

* By forgoing a backend we can focus on our core functionality first and worry about that implementation later if needed.

### Negative Consequences 

* Limits what our app can do.
