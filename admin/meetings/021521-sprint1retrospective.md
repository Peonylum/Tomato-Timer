**Retrospective presented by sub-group leads**
* Task List sub-group: <br/>

        - Having everyone do research on task list creation
        - Task list was not too difficult
    * What could be improved:
        - Communication could have been better
        - Hopes to have better task division since Dylan did most of the coding
- Progress Bar sub-group: <br/>
    * What worked well:
        - Easy to work in sub-groups
        - Having demo and figma to build off of
        - Communication in slack channel was good
        - Meeting times were productive
    * What coule be improved:
        - Asynchronous stand-up was a bit of a mess
        - Hard to complete a lot because of short sprint
          and because all team members were not well-versed in Javascript
- Settings sub-group: <br/>
    * What worked well:
        - Settings code was pretty straightforward so it was not difficult to implement it
        - Last week was a busy week so there was not enough time to code out all of the settings feature
        - Communication was not very good and could be improved
